Subject : To Read and flash leds using button/switch by javascript code
Lab Partner Names : Merlin & Charlotte Yoder

In lab02 we were supposed to wire up leds and flash them on/off by writing codes, command lines or by manual input from pressing a button.
Codes were available on cloud9 interface and then copied unto the git hub repository and further edited to suit the wiring. eg. Here it is P9_14 header where the leds were wired up.

1. blinkled.js - Simple program to flash the leds on beaglebone (blue leds next to reset button) and the led wired up on breadboard
2. switchled.js - Program to control the led using the switch. It will blink on the pressing of button
3. top_led_blink.js - To flash the top led when any button is pressed and both leds light when both switches are pressed
4. blink_led_tentimes.js - To flash the leds 10 times when switch is pressed
5. blink_alternate.js - On Pressing one switch LED starts blinking while pressing another switch stops the LED from blinking.
