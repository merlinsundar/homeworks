Subject : To Read and flash leds using button/switch by javascript code
Lab Partner Names : Merlin & Charlotte Yoder

In lab02 we were supposed to wire up leds and flash them on/off by writing codes, command lines or by manual input from pressing a button.
Codes were available on cloud9 interface and then copied unto the git hub repository and further edited to suit the wiring. eg. Here it is P9_14 header where the leds were wired up.

1. blinkled.js - Simple program to flash the leds on beaglebone (blue leds next to reset button) and the led wired up on breadboard
2. switchled.js - Program to control the led using the switch. It will blink on the pressing of button
3. top_led_blink.js - To flash the top led when any button is pressed and both leds light when both switches are pressed
4. blink_led_tentimes.js - To flash the leds 10 times when switch is pressed
5. blink_alternate.js - On Pressing one switch LED starts blinking while pressing another switch stops the LED from blinking.


From the command line- 

We were able to fire up leds, change their color and see the folders withing sys/class etc all from command line after connecting the beaglebone to the computer.

Also downloaded the Fritzing software and learned to fiddle with its ADAfruit feature to customize the beagebone features.
