In this lab we were required to light up LED matrix ie. i2c ports and do something different with it.

1) Matrix_hex.js - This code was used to display a hexagon on the Matrices, altought it was'nt a perfect hexagon. 
2) MatrixLedi2c.js - This code is used to show patterns of smile, frown , fading in and out after the given time in the code.
3) MatrixLed12c2.js - This code is used to show the same patterns , but this time controlled by buttons, also fixed on the beagle bone.
One button was used to display all the faces in sequence while the other button was used to fade the patterns in and out.
