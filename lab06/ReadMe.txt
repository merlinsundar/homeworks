In this lab we got to play with joystick and thus control LEds(we could not get LED matrix) and encoders tocontrol the blinking rate of LEDs just like that of a switch or button previously used in other labs

joystick_leds.js - this aims at lighting up two leds. 
encoder.js - does the same function here like joystick.
