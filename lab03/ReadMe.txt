Subject : To read analog voltage from variable resistor and thereafter control led brightness by javascript code
Lab Partner Names : Merlin & Charlotte Yoder

In lab03 we were supposed to wire up potentiometer and vary the voltage using its knob(0 - 1.8V). Also using a flash led and potentiometer we have to control the brightness of the led. That it if the voltage is 0 then the les remains off and when it reaches its highest voltage point is. +1.8V it should turn brightest.

1. input_analog.js - Simple javascript to read the analog value of the potentiometere on turning the knob
2. input_fade_input_parallely.js - program to fade in and out of leds parallely controlled by the potentiometer.
3. input_fade_leds_subsequently.js - program to fade out the top led while the bottom led is fading in and vice versa controlled by the potentiometer

We were also able to alter the jsfiddle module to turn the potentiometer and thereafter read the values by changing the code and the html file display alittle bit here and there.
