Lab Partner Names : Merlin & Charlotte Yoder

In this lab we were supposed to use a Range Sensor that would tell us the range and Proximity of an object say a notebook.

Range_sensor.js - We coded the sensor to find the distance of a notebook from it.
By taking into account that speed of sound is 343m/s
We calculated the distance using the formula for distance : Time *speed = distance

The recorded distances for the sensor is in file range.pdf
