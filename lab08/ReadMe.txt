Were done with PreLab but unfortunately could not complete lab on time, due to hardware(beagelbone) error and the memory had to be flashed. 
Had to begin all over again from scratch.
We were able to modify and run the code for hello2.c with our address in it.
Also the log files displayed the modifications made.

Hello2.c - modify to display name and our address.
