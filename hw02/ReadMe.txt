Etch-a-sketch looks nice, but doesn't respond to button P9_18.

------------------------------------------------

Etch_a_sketch.js  - This script is used to play the traditional etch-a-sketch game using buttons that are configured in our script
                  
Blink_leds.js     - This script also is the same game but, here the buttons use a different display system ie. the leds to either display or not to. The leds will go on or off depending upon the button that is pressed, which is also configured in the given code.
