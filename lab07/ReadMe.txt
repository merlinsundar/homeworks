We got to play with accelerometer and gyroscopes in this lab, but unfortunately our gyroscope was not working so the delay in getting the results.

Gyro.js - to get the value of sensors , the layout is shown in the fritzing diagram.

to direct all the result to a webpage, we had to write a code using jsfiddle talking directly from bone.
